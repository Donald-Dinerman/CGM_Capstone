## Project Overview

The capstone project aims to investigate the relationships between psychosocial variables (such as happiness, depression, anxiety, and social interactions) and blood glucose levels in Southwest Pennsylvania teens with Type 1 diabetes. The data set used in the project includes EMA and CGM data.

The project's main focus is on exploring the relationship between the psychosocial variables in the data set and the survey respondents' blood glucose levels. The project aims to answer questions such as: Is there a correlation between the psychosocial variables and blood glucose levels? Do certain psychosocial variables have a more significant impact on blood glucose levels than others?
